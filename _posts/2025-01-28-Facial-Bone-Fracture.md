description: Facial bone fractures are among the most frequent injuries seen in trauma and maxillofacial units. They can result from a variety of accidents or violent impacts and may range from simple, non-displaced fractures to complex multi-bone injuries. Because the face plays a vital role in aesthetics, expression, vision, breathing, speech, and mastication, prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to restore both function and appearance.

# Facial Bone Fractures: Causes, Types, Diagnosis, and Treatment

**Common Causes of Facial Bone Fractures**<br>
Facial fractures are caused by blunt or penetrating trauma to the face. The most common causes include:
 - **Road traffic accidents** – Especially involving motor vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles, or e-scooters (monopattini), where the face directly impacts hard surfaces or objects.
 - **Sports injuries** – Particularly in contact sports such as boxing, football, rugby, or hockey.
 - **Falls** – Common among children and the elderly, or in occupational accidents.
 - **Assaults (colluttazioni)** – Physical altercations or interpersonal violence are a significant cause, often resulting in isolated jaw or nasal fractures.
 - **Workplace or industrial accidents** – Especially when safety equipment is not used.
The severity of the fracture depends on the intensity and direction of impact, as well as individual factors such as bone density and pre-existing facial anatomy.



**Most Common Types of Facial Bone Fractures**<br>
The facial skeleton is composed of multiple bones forming the upper, middle, and lower facial structures. The most commonly affected are:

1. **Nasal Bone Fractures**
The most frequent facial fracture due to the nose’s central and prominent position.
Can result from even minor trauma.
Symptoms include pain, swelling, nasal deformity, epistaxis (nosebleed), and nasal obstruction.
Usually diagnosed clinically, with imaging if displacement or septal injury is suspected.

2. **Zygomatic (Cheekbone) Fractures**
The zygomatic bone forms the cheek prominence and part of the orbital rim.
Fractures here may affect appearance, ocular function, and bite.
Typical signs include flattened cheek contour, periorbital bruising, trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), numbness of the cheek or upper lip (due to infraorbital nerve injury), and double vision if the orbital floor is involved.

3. **Maxillary Fractures (Midface / Le Fort Fractures)**
Involve the upper jaw and may range from simple alveolar fractures to complex midfacial fractures (Le Fort I, II, III).
Symptoms include facial elongation, mobility of the upper jaw, malocclusion, epistaxis, swelling, and bruising around the eyes (panda eyes).
Often occur in high-impact injuries, such as car or scooter accidents.

4. **Mandibular (Jaw) Fractures**
The second most common facial fracture.
Common sites: condyle, angle, body, and symphysis.
Condylar fractures are particularly frequent due to indirect forces transmitted through the chin.
Symptoms include pain on chewing, malocclusion, deviation of the jaw during opening, limited mouth opening, and preauricular swelling.

5. **Orbital Fractures**
May involve the orbital floor (“blowout fracture”) or the orbital rim.
Symptoms: double vision (diplopia), restricted eye movement, sunken eye (enophthalmos), and numbness in the infraorbital region.
Can be associated with zygomatic fractures or isolated due to sports injuries or falls.

6. **Frontal Bone Fractures**
Result from high-energy trauma.
May involve the frontal sinus and can lead to complications such as CSF leaks or infection if the sinus is breached.
Require careful imaging and multidisciplinary management.



**Signs and Symptoms**<br>
The clinical presentation of facial fractures varies depending on the site and severity but commonly includes:
 - Pain, swelling, and bruising over the injured area.
 - Facial asymmetry or deformity.
 - Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or ears.
 - Difficulty opening the mouth or chewing.
 - Altered bite or malocclusion.
 - Numbness due to nerve injury (especially infraorbital or mental nerve).
 - Double vision (diplopia) or restricted eye movement.
 - Epistaxis or nasal obstruction in nasal and maxillary fractures.
 - Crepitus (grating sensation) or mobility of bone fragments on palpation.




**Diagnosis**<br>
1. Clinical Examination:
A thorough examination is essential, assessing:
Facial symmetry, occlusion, and mobility of bone segments.
Soft tissue injuries, swelling, bruising, and sensory changes.
Ocular examination for vision, diplopia, and globe position.
Nasal examination for septal hematoma (which must be treated urgently).

2. Imaging Studies:
Plain radiographs (X-rays) – Useful for simple nasal or mandibular fractures.
CT scans (computed tomography) – The gold standard for detailed evaluation of facial bone fractures, providing 3D assessment of bone displacement, comminution, and orbital involvement.
3D reconstructions – Helpful for surgical planning in complex fractures.




**Treatment**<br>
Treatment aims to restore facial symmetry, function, and occlusion, while minimizing complications and long-term deformities.

1. Conservative (Non-Surgical) Management:  Not all facial fractures require surgery.
Indications for conservative treatment include:
 - Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures.
 - Stable occlusion without functional impairment.
 - Patients with medical contraindications for surgery.
Conservative management may include:
 - Rest, soft or liquid diet, and analgesics. 
 - Cold compresses to reduce swelling.
 - Antibiotics for open fractures or mucosal involvement.
 - Regular follow-up to ensure healing and monitor function.

2. Closed Reduction:
In some cases, such as nasal bone or zygomatic arch fractures, manual or instrument-assisted closed reduction can reposition the bones without open surgery.
This is usually done under local or general anaesthesia, and splints or supports may be used temporarily.

3. Surgical Treatment (Open Reduction and Internal Fixation – ORIF)
Indicated when there is:
 - Significant bone displacement or deformity.
 - Malocclusion or functional impairment.
 - Orbital involvement causing diplopia or enophthalmos.
 - Comminuted or unstable fractures.

Procedure:
 - The surgeon makes incisions (usually intraoral or hidden within natural creases) to access the fracture.
 - The bone fragments are realigned and stabilized using titanium plates and screws — a process known as osteosynthesis.
 - These materials are biocompatible and typically left in place permanently.
 - Postoperative care includes antibiotics, soft diet, oral hygiene maintenance, and follow-up imaging.



**Prognosis and Recovery**<br>
Most facial bone fractures heal well with appropriate management.
 - Swelling and bruising usually subside within 2–3 weeks.
 - Bone healing typically takes 6–8 weeks, depending on the site and severity.
 - Physical activities or contact sports should be avoided during this period.
Early diagnosis, careful surgical planning, and coordinated multidisciplinary care (maxillofacial surgeon, ENT, ophthalmologist, and dentist) are crucial for achieving optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes.
