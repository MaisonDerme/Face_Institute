description: Facial bone fractures are among the most frequent injuries seen in trauma and maxillofacial units. They can result from a variety of accidents or violent impacts and may range from simple, non-displaced fractures to complex multi-bone injuries. Because the face plays a vital role in aesthetics, expression, vision, breathing, speech, and mastication, prompt diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to restore both function and appearance.
