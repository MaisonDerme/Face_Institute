# Aesthetic medicine
Aesthetic medicine encompasses medical procedures that aim to improve physical appearance and patient satisfaction, using both invasive and non-invasive techniques like injections, lasers, chemical peels, and surgery. It is an elective field focused on enhancing or restoring features, treating aging effects, and improving body image, and it is often performed on healthy individuals. Treatments are designed to improve the skin, face, and body, addressing concerns such as wrinkles, sagging, and scars.

Few examples:

**Rhinofiller**<br>
Rhinofiller is a non-surgical nose reshaping procedure that uses dermal fillers (commonly hyaluronic acid–based) to smooth out irregularities, correct asymmetry, or lift the nasal tip without surgery.
The filler is carefully injected into specific areas of the nose to enhance shape and contour, offering immediate results with minimal downtime. Temporary swelling or bruising may occur, but these usually settle within a few days. Results typically last 9–18 months, depending on the product used and individual factors.

**Biorevitalization**<br>
Biorevitalization is a non-surgical skin rejuvenation treatment that involves injecting small amounts of hyaluronic acid and other nourishing substances (such as vitamins, amino acids, or antioxidants) into the superficial layers of the skin using fine needles.
It helps to hydrate the skin deeply, stimulate collagen production, and improve elasticity and radiance.
After the procedure, you may notice mild redness, swelling, or small bumps at the injection sites, which usually disappear within 1–2 days. 
A series of sessions is often recommended for the best results.

**Lip-filler**<br>
Lip filler treatment enhances the shape, volume, and definition of the lips using hyaluronic acid–based dermal fillers. It can also improve hydration and correct asymmetry.
The procedure involves small, precise injections and is usually performed under local or topical anaesthesia for comfort.
After the treatment, it is normal to experience mild swelling or tenderness for 1–2 days. The results are visible immediately and typically last 6–12 months.
Regular touch-ups help maintain the desired look.
