# Aesthetic medicine
Aesthetic medicine encompasses medical procedures that aim to improve physical appearance and patient satisfaction, using both invasive and non-invasive techniques like injections, lasers, chemical peels, and surgery. It is an elective field focused on enhancing or restoring features, treating aging effects, and improving body image, and it is often performed on healthy individuals. Treatments are designed to improve the skin, face, and body, addressing concerns such as wrinkles, sagging, and scars.
