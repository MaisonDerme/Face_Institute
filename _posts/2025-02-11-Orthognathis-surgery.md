description: Orthognathic surgery is a type of corrective facial surgery performed to reposition and realign the jaws (maxilla and mandible) to achieve proper function and facial balance. It’s usually indicated when there are significant skeletal discrepancies between the upper and lower jaws that cannot be corrected by orthodontic treatment alone.

# Orthognathic Surgery
This procedure is typically carried out by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon in collaboration with an orthodontist.
The goals of orthognathic surgery include:
Improving chewing, speech, and breathing functions.
Correcting bite abnormalities (such as overbite, underbite, or open bite).
Enhancing facial aesthetics and symmetry.
Alleviating jaw pain or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems in some cases.

The surgery involves cutting and repositioning sections of the jawbone, then securing them with plates, screws, or wires. Recovery typically includes a period of healing and orthodontic adjustment afterward.

# Double Jaw (Orthognathic) Surgery – What to Expect:

**Before the Surgery**<br>
Orthodontic Preparation:
Before surgery, you will need to wear braces for several months (usually 12–18 months) as part of the preparation. The purpose of this orthodontic phase is to move your teeth into the ideal positions relative to each jaw, rather than to make your bite perfect at this stage.
This means that, during this period, your bite and dental alignment may actually seem worse than before you started. You might notice gaps between teeth or that your upper and lower teeth no longer fit together properly. This is completely normal and expected — it allows the surgeon to move the jaws accurately during surgery so they come together correctly afterward.
Your orthodontist and surgeon will work closely together, reviewing your progress and planning your final jaw position with the help of clinical models, X-rays, and digital 3D scans.

Preoperative Assessments:
Before surgery, you will attend several appointments, including:
Clinical and radiological evaluation (photos, X-rays, 3D scans).
Preoperative instructions regarding fasting, medications, and what to bring to the hospital.
Sometimes, blood tests and anaesthetic assessment will be arranged to ensure you are fit for surgery.
You may also be advised to stop smoking, as smoking can delay healing and increase the risk of complications.


**The Day of Surgery**<br>
Before the Operation:
You will be admitted to the hospital, usually on the day of surgery.
You’ll meet the surgical and anaesthetic team, who will review your case and answer any last-minute questions. You’ll need to fast for several hours before the operation (usually nothing to eat or drink from midnight).
When you go to the operating room, the anaesthetist will give you general anaesthesia so you are completely asleep and pain-free during the procedure.

During the Operation:
The surgeon will make incisions inside your mouth, so there will be no visible scars on your face.
The upper and lower jaws are carefully repositioned according to the preoperative plan.
The bones are then secured in their new position using small titanium plates and screws that remain permanently in place (they are biocompatible and usually do not need to be removed).
The procedure may take 3 to 6 hours, depending on the complexity of your case.
After completion, your surgeon will check your new bite and apply guiding elastics or light intermaxillary fixation (IMF) if needed, to help your jaws stay in the correct position.

After the Operation (in the Ward):
When the operation is over, you will wake up in the recovery area, where nurses will monitor your breathing, blood pressure, and comfort. You will then be transferred to the ward.
Common things you might experience include:
Facial swelling and bruising, which gradually increase over the first 48–72 hours.
Numbness around the lips, cheeks, or chin, which is common and usually temporary.
Tightness or stiffness when trying to open your mouth.
A small amount of bleeding from the nose or mouth during the first day or two.
You will receive:
Pain relief medication.
Antibiotics to prevent infection.
Ice packs to help reduce swelling.
Intravenous fluids until you are able to drink properly.
Most patients stay in the hospital for 2–4 days after surgery, depending on recovery.


**Recovery Phase**<br>
Swelling (Edema):
Swelling is a normal part of healing. It usually peaks around 2–3 days after surgery and then gradually subsides over the next few weeks. Keeping your head elevated and applying cold compresses can help reduce it.

Diet and Nutrition:
For the first few weeks, you will be on a liquid or pureed diet, as your jaws will be healing and possibly held together with elastics or light fixation.
You should:
Drink high-calorie, high-protein liquids (smoothies, soups, milkshakes) to maintain nutrition.
Avoid chewing until your surgeon or orthodontist advises that it is safe.
Gradually progress to soft foods as healing improves, usually after 4–6 weeks.

Intermaxillary Fixation / Elastics:
Elastics or light rubber bands may be placed between your upper and lower braces to help guide your bite during healing.
You may be able to open your mouth slightly, but movement will be limited. Your surgeon will tell you how to manage these elastics and when they can be removed.

Oral Hygiene:
Good oral hygiene is essential to prevent infection:
Rinse your mouth with prescribed antiseptic mouthwash (such as chlorhexidine) several times a day, especially after meals.
Brush gently with a soft or baby toothbrush, avoiding surgical areas initially.
Keep your lips moist using lip balm or petroleum jelly, as they can become dry or cracked.

Follow-up Visits:
You will have regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon and orthodontist to:
Monitor healing and bite alignment.
Adjust or remove elastics.
Take postoperative X-rays to check bone healing.

Recovery Timeline:
Most swelling improves significantly within 3–4 weeks.
Normal diet and jaw movement gradually return by 6–8 weeks.
Complete bone healing and final orthodontic adjustments may take 6–12 months.
