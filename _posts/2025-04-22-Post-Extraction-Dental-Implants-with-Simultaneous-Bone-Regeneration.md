**Indications**<br>
Immediate post-extraction implant placement is indicated in cases where the extraction socket presents with sufficient residual alveolar bone to ensure adequate primary implant stability. It is particularly advantageous in minimizing alveolar ridge resorption, reducing the number of surgical interventions, and shortening the overall treatment time. This approach is generally contraindicated in the presence of acute infection, compromised soft tissue conditions, or extensive bone defects that would prevent primary implant stabilization. In the present case, post-extraction implant placement was selected to preserve the alveolar ridge architecture and to facilitate optimal prosthetic rehabilitation.

**Surgical Procedure**<br>
After administration of local anesthesia, a minimally invasive, atraumatic extraction of the compromised teeth 36 and 37 was performed to preserve the integrity of the alveolar walls. The sockets were carefully debrided to remove any granulation tissue and to promote bleeding at the bone surface. A sequential drilling protocol was carried out under copious irrigation, following the manufacturer’s guidelines, to prepare the implant beds within the interradicular bone septum. Two dental implant were inserted with controlled torque to achieve primary stability, ensuring the implant platforms were positioned at the appropriate crestal level.

**Bone Regeneration Technique**<br>
Autogenous bone chips were collected intraoperatively using a bone scraper from adjacent cortical areas and mixed in a sterile dish with xenogeneic graft material (Bio-Oss® granules) in a 1:1 ratio. This composite graft was used to fill the residual peri-implant gap and any bone defects between the distal implant 37 surface and the socket walls. The grafted area was subsequently covered with a resorbable collagen membrane (Membrane Flex®) to stabilize the graft particles and prevent soft tissue invasion. The membrane was secured in place using titanium fixation pins, ensuring intimate adaptation over the graft and maintenance of the regenerative space required for new bone formation.

**Closure and Postoperative Management**<br>
The surgical flap was repositioned to achieve tension-free primary closure, and interrupted sutures were placed to ensure stable wound margins. Postoperative instructions included antibiotic prophylaxis, analgesic medication, and chlorhexidine mouth rinses. The patient was advised to maintain strict oral hygiene and avoid mechanical trauma to the surgical site. A healing period of approximately 4–6 months was planned, during which osseointegration and bone regeneration were expected to occur. Radiographic and clinical evaluations were scheduled periodically to monitor healing and assess graft integration.

**Prosthetic Rehabilitation**<br>
At the time of the prosthetic phase, radiographic evaluation demonstrated satisfactory bone regeneration around implant site 37, with well-defined trabecular bone formation and stable marginal bone levels. Clinically, the peri-implant soft tissues appeared healthy, exhibiting normal color, contour, and absence of inflammation or bleeding on probing. Given the favorable biological and structural conditions, the definitive prosthetic restoration was carried out. Custom abutments were positioned, and screw-retained ceramic crowns were placed on implants 36 and 37, ensuring optimal occlusal balance and aesthetic integration. The rehabilitation was completed successfully, restoring function, comfort, and harmony within the dental arch.
